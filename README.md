Corner blocks for Minetest
==========================

Minetest seems to be missing the corner blocks that are used with stairs. These
appear automatically in Minecraft, but this doesn't seem to be the case in
Minetest. They are useful for making the roofs of buildings. This simple demo
mod adds these to the inventory.
